# biodiversity-dashboard
Contains code to build an interactive dashboard to explore dataset on microbes that colonize human navels. The final interactive dashboard can be found here: https://hannah8075.github.io/biodiversity-dashboard/.

## Data
The data is stored in a json file called sample.json.

## Code
The html code is saved as index.html with corresponding javascript files in the static/js folder. 

## Interactive Dashboard
The interactive dashboard contains a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual, a bubble chart that displays each sample, as well as a gauge chart of the weekly washing frequency of the individual.

Charts are updated when the dropdown menu selection changes.
